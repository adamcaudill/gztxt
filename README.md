##gztxt - A GZip Compressed Text File Format

####Status
Planning. Currently working on the proof on concept.


####What is this?
A .gztxt file is a standard .txt that has been compressed with [gzip]() to make transport more efficient. This makes transfering and storing certain files (i.e. logs) easier.

What prompted this was the need to email error reports containg log files, without placing too much burden on email servers by storing large attachments.

####Use
Coming soon.
